1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Rice Cooker is Uncle Roger.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Say everything and this chef tried to make three cost meals with only rice cooker.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fuyo!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm Alexis, your chef who is always up for challenge.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Rice Cooker, no problem.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This lady last time makes salmon with coffee maker.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And her salmon looked like it has herpes.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hiya!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Was she too better this time?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ms. Annefew, remember to subscribe to Uncle Roger channel.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When we hit 4 million subscribers,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Uncle Roger gonna make my own ramen and Ms. Annefew can judge me.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Welcome back to Chef out of Water.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm Alexis, your chef who is always up for challenge.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's see what's next.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh my god, Ms. Alexis have two rice cooker.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Uncle Roger, faithful to my one rice cooker.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But niece Alexis is rice cooker fucko.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of course I've used rice cooker to make rice before but never anything else.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So it turns out people make all sorts of things with rice cookers.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Correct.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Correct.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We do.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sausage.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think this is gonna be really interesting that it only has two features which are cook and warm.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Only two features, hiya.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why your rice cooker so ghetto?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This rice cooker is basic as niece Alexis.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Uncle Roger rice cooker has so many features.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It has white rice, sushi rice, porridge and brown rice.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This rice cooker has more feature that Auntie Helen have affair.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She's a cheating host.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm gonna start off with dessert.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to try to make a chocolate cake today.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Chocolate cake good choice.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Rice cooker actually very good at making cake.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you google, you will see so many recipes out there for rice cooker cake.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Because Asian people, we hate arwen.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We don't use it.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It only used for storing pot and pan.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a convenient place to store things you want to hit your kid with.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
First thing I need to do is put it on.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's not really an honor off button.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's just plugging it in.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No idea how long it takes to preheat but...

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, no, no need to preheat this rice cooker.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This not arwen, hiya.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Life too short for preheating.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Got some room temperature butter.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brown sugar.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Eggs.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good vanilla.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Good ingredient for cake.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Powder.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Baking powder.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is all very standard.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rice cooker are basically steam.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So it'll be more like a steamed cake than a baked cake.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In Asia, steam cake is very common.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You go get dim sum and you have marlai go and la baco.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Uncle Roger think rice cooker for cake is great idea.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fancy trick time.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To get a perfect circle.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
To use parchment.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You fold it, put it over your bowl.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And you just cut like this.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Fuyu!

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That magic trick is she a witch or something.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Fuyu, I did it also.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Almost perfect circle.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just here, I fucked up.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So cake batter in the rice cooker.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A few minutes later.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to take my cold cake.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to cut out three mini cakes.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to make a mini chocolate layered cake.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, if I stack three of them,

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that looks absolutely crazy.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That looks absolutely crazy.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Uncle Roger definition of crazy is someone who stab you and burn your house down.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But these Alexis definition of crazy is cake with tree layer.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But I could cut them in half and do thinner layers.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, I can make a four layer cake.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Four layer.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That must be extra crazy.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Four, four.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Four layer cake is psychopath behavior.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Chicken and potatoes.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Classic.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This actually isn't a chicken.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a Cornish game hen because this is so small,

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a chicken wasn't going to fit inside.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like Uncle Roger always say,

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
it's not the size, it how you use it.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry children.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to try to get some color from the bottom.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But just in case I thought doing like some paprika rub would help give it.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, paprika rub is like fake tan for chicken.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Coriander salt.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't be shy.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Throw some MSG in there also.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't need salt.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, something concerning.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The rice cooker is switched from cook to warm.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And when I press cook, it just goes to warm.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is enough for you.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is happening because this is how basic rice cooker like this will turn off by itself

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
when it realizes rice is done cooking.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And they do this by detecting temperature.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Before rice done cooking, there's still water on bottom.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So bottom of rice cooker temperature will not be higher than 100 degrees Celsius

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because that's the boiling point of water.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But when rice done cooking, all the water evaporates.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So bottom of rice cooker will be higher than 100 degrees Celsius.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And their sensor in there detecting this and will turn off rice cooker by itself.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
See? Uncle Roger brain so much science.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Miss Alexis, if you want to keep rice cooker on all the time,

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
just make sure they always water at the bottom of rice cooker.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Keep watching this video.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's see if she figured it out.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're just cutting some aromatics right now.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Add some flavor to the base of the chicken.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, this is going to be a long day.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Or maybe a kitchen haunted and that goes in there turning it off to fuck with you.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's making the right sound.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It sounds right, smells right.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The sizzling sound good.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wow, this is gorgeous.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Free, fly free.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, no, that very cruel.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Chicken can't even fly when it alive.

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't give that chicken false hope, hi.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just going to get a little more color on...

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, this is switched to warm to her.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ah, I have to be honest, I don't know what to do.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hi, uh, eat the add some water.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Or hire intern whose whole job is to hold down button for you.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It feels like something's wrong with this machine.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It can't be me.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It definitely you.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know about machines.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So the cake looks like it's actually staying on cook,

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which I think is because of the water in the base.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, she's thicker.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It out for you.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This Alexa is so smart.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The chicken, I need to get it back to cook and then cook it with some white wine.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So it adds more moisture.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Very good idea using wine because wine boiling point even lower than water.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So machine won't turn off by itself and also wine has more flavor.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Not bad, not bad.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Looking nice, looking nice.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Crispy skin because it was kind of like in liquid,

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but there's some browning.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's quite pretty.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This is gorgeous.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's like all this sauceiness.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You see?

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She trolled the whole pop of garlic in there.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uncle Roger, like garlic is one of Uncle Roger's favorite ingredient.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Many needs an nephew complaining.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Chopping garlic, peeling garlic.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Make your hands smell like garlic.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is the solution.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't even chop.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Just chop the whole thing in there.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now that my chicken's done,

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm gonna get my potatoes ready.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The same basket worked with cake.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hi, you have rice cooker.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why don't you just make rice as your cup?

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No need potato.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
In life, you only need three packs of cup.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Rice, noodle or rice noodle.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hashtag potato soul name.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nice and nephew.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tweet this.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's get it trending.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Finally, a dish that makes sense for a rice cooker.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to make mussels and white wine.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Finally, a dish that makes sense for a rice cooker.

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mussels and white wine.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When she say a dish that makes sense for rice cooker,

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I thought she was going to make rice but mussels.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She chose to make chicken mussels and cake in rice cooker.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That show you how versatile rice cooker is.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can make white people food also.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mussels are in so many fancy restaurants.

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it's definitely something people associate with a higher price tag.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But the whole joke is that mussels are actually super inexpensive.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're one of the most affordable seafood options.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That correct.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It most affordable seafood option.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you also like mussels that give you diarrhea.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Onion, garlic, pepper flakes, white wine.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You don't need much to give mussels such an incredible flavor.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wow, they're so pretty.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Look good, not bad.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, this broth looks...

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Rough not bad also.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So good.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I just added some lemon.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Adding parsley.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It looks...

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Fuiyo, this looks so nice.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Good job, Nis Alexis.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If Jamie Oliver sees this, I sure he will go...

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah!

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hi, I'm Ryan.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm a...

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, now they do taste test with nephew Ryan here.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A video producer at BuzzFeed, I make branded content.

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I cook out of necessity.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't cook for pleasure.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Like last night I had plain chicken and plain pasta.

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And I ate it in the dark.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What did he say?

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What did he say?

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Last night I had plain chicken and plain pasta.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I ate it in the dark.

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hi, I eat in dark.

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you poor?

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So poverty.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
BuzzFeed pay or we joke I bet.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So he cut a f*** electric.

228
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, baby he too cheap and he want to save money

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
on electric bill high.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Turn on like more.

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you can see how terrible that shade of pink look on you.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Alexis has made a three-course meal for me

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
with a mystery appliance.

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know what the appliance is,

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but I'm going to try and guess.

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bring them in.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're a tree.

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're a tree.

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, yeah.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This must be recorded before Covid time.

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know.

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Uncle Roger misharking.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
About...

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, okay.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For your first course you...

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ooh!

248
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In white wine.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Very nice.

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you like mussels?

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I love mussels.

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I love mussels.

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's also what Auntie Helen say to me

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
right before she left me for that fitness motto.

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What is love?

256
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh my god!

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm so bad you're hungry because...

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ooh, chicken look good.

259
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We're game hands.

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Look nice.

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Over some sauteed onions and mashed potatoes.

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Nice potato, so creamy and smooth.

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Very nice, nice Alexis.

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is so good.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That is.

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well seasoned.

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ooh.

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Whoa!

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Fuyo!

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This chocolate cake looks so nice too?

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, damn, that's too big.

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uncle Roger getting hungry now.

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What do you think I used to make this meal?

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It had...

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There had to be enough heat to get this crust

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and like this...

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
G...

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
curling iron.

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Broom!

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What do you think I used to make this meal?

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Uh, curling iron.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Curling iron!

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How do you think she make mussels with curling iron?

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is she gonna co-every single mussel or something?

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No.

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I want to get it right.

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A bathtub.

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Bath tub.

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There's no fuel iron.

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Bad at turning light on and also bad at guessing.

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think it's gonna take two more years before he gets it right.

294
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What next guest gonna be?

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Washing machine.

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Overheated laptop.

297
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hiya.

298
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, that's bad, yes.

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's it.

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's such a bad guess.

301
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know it, bad guys and you still do...

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Right.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was right.

304
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wow.

305
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Nice cooker!

306
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Just not bad, Miss Alexis.

308
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This very good result.

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Uncle Roger approved

310
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Use rice cooker to make everything.

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Uncle Roger loves it when white people use rice cooker.

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because it means you enlightened white people.

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Miss Annaphyu.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Go get rice cooker.

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's so multi-purpose.

316
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Can make chicken, can make cake, can make mussel.

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But most importantly, can sing for you.

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But Miss Alexis is rice cooker fucker.

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is the same joke that I did in the Gordon Ramsay video.

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But it's still funny.

321
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She's cheating ho.

322
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No light at all.

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why?

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You live in America.

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Not gas or strip.

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Can I put it?

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

328
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Put it in the blueprints.

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Neff fuel Ryan.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Turn on light more.

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So you can see how terrible that shape of light like look on you.

332
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Light like, I think light like, it's funnier maybe.

333
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But Uncle Roger probably wouldn't know the word light like.

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So it's maybe a bit off character.

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Rice Cooker is Uncle Roger.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Say everything and this chef tried to make three cost meals with only rice cooker.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Fuyo!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm Alexis, your chef who is always up for challenge.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Rice Cooker, no problem.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
This lady last time makes salmon with coffee maker.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
And her salmon looked like it has herpes.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Hiya!

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Was she too better this time?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Ms. Annefew, remember to subscribe to Uncle Roger channel.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
When we hit 4 million subscribers,

12
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Uncle Roger gonna make my own ramen and Ms. Annefew can judge me.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Welcome back to Chef out of Water.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm Alexis, your chef who is always up for challenge.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So let's see what's next.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh my god, Ms. Alexis have two rice cooker.

17
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Uncle Roger, faithful to my one rice cooker.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But niece Alexis is rice cooker fucko.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Of course I've used rice cooker to make rice before but never anything else.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So it turns out people make all sorts of things with rice cookers.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Correct.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Correct.

23
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,000
We do.

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Sausage.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I think this is gonna be really interesting that it only has two features which are cook and warm.

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Only two features, hiya.

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why your rice cooker so ghetto?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This rice cooker is basic as niece Alexis.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Uncle Roger rice cooker has so many features.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It has white rice, sushi rice, porridge and brown rice.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This rice cooker has more feature that Auntie Helen have affair.

32
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She's a cheating host.

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm gonna start off with dessert.

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm going to try to make a chocolate cake today.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Chocolate cake good choice.

36
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Rice cooker actually very good at making cake.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you google, you will see so many recipes out there for rice cooker cake.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Because Asian people, we hate arwen.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
We don't use it.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It only used for storing pot and pan.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's a convenient place to store things you want to hit your kid with.

42
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
First thing I need to do is put it on.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There's not really an honor off button.

44
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's just plugging it in.

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No idea how long it takes to preheat but...

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
No, no, no need to preheat this rice cooker.

47
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This not arwen, hiya.

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Life too short for preheating.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Got some room temperature butter.

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Brown sugar.

51
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Eggs.

52
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Good vanilla.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Good ingredient for cake.

54
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Powder.

55
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Baking powder.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
This is all very standard.

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Rice cooker are basically steam.

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So it'll be more like a steamed cake than a baked cake.

59
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In Asia, steam cake is very common.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
You go get dim sum and you have marlai go and la baco.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Uncle Roger think rice cooker for cake is great idea.

62
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fancy trick time.

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
To get a perfect circle.

64
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
To use parchment.

65
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You fold it, put it over your bowl.

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And you just cut like this.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Fuyu!

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That magic trick is she a witch or something.

69
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Fuyu, I did it also.

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Almost perfect circle.

71
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Just here, I fucked up.

72
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
So cake batter in the rice cooker.

73
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
A few minutes later.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm going to take my cold cake.

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm going to cut out three mini cakes.

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm going to make a mini chocolate layered cake.

77
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Okay, if I stack three of them,

78
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
that looks absolutely crazy.

79
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That looks absolutely crazy.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Uncle Roger definition of crazy is someone who stab you and burn your house down.

81
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
But these Alexis definition of crazy is cake with tree layer.

82
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
But I could cut them in half and do thinner layers.

83
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, I can make a four layer cake.

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Four layer.

85
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That must be extra crazy.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Four, four.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Four layer cake is psychopath behavior.

88
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Chicken and potatoes.

89
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Classic.

90
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
This actually isn't a chicken.

91
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's a Cornish game hen because this is so small,

92
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
a chicken wasn't going to fit inside.

93
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Like Uncle Roger always say,

94
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
it's not the size, it how you use it.

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sorry children.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm going to try to get some color from the bottom.

97
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But just in case I thought doing like some paprika rub would help give it.

98
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay, paprika rub is like fake tan for chicken.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Coriander salt.

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Don't be shy.

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Throw some MSG in there also.

102
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Don't need salt.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Okay, something concerning.

104
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The rice cooker is switched from cook to warm.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And when I press cook, it just goes to warm.

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This is enough for you.

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
This is happening because this is how basic rice cooker like this will turn off by itself

108
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
when it realizes rice is done cooking.

109
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And they do this by detecting temperature.

110
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Before rice done cooking, there's still water on bottom.

111
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So bottom of rice cooker temperature will not be higher than 100 degrees Celsius

112
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
because that's the boiling point of water.

113
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But when rice done cooking, all the water evaporates.

114
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
So bottom of rice cooker will be higher than 100 degrees Celsius.

115
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And their sensor in there detecting this and will turn off rice cooker by itself.

116
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
See? Uncle Roger brain so much science.

117
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Miss Alexis, if you want to keep rice cooker on all the time,

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
just make sure they always water at the bottom of rice cooker.

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Keep watching this video.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's see if she figured it out.

121
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We're just cutting some aromatics right now.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Add some flavor to the base of the chicken.

123
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, this is going to be a long day.

124
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Or maybe a kitchen haunted and that goes in there turning it off to fuck with you.

125
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's making the right sound.

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It sounds right, smells right.

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The sizzling sound good.

128
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Wow, this is gorgeous.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Free, fly free.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
No, no, that very cruel.

131
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Chicken can't even fly when it alive.

132
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't give that chicken false hope, hi.

133
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Just going to get a little more color on...

134
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, this is switched to warm to her.

135
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Ah, I have to be honest, I don't know what to do.

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hi, uh, eat the add some water.

137
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Or hire intern whose whole job is to hold down button for you.

138
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It feels like something's wrong with this machine.

139
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It can't be me.

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It definitely you.

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I know about machines.

142
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So the cake looks like it's actually staying on cook,

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
which I think is because of the water in the base.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, she's thicker.

145
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It out for you.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
This Alexa is so smart.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
The chicken, I need to get it back to cook and then cook it with some white wine.

148
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So it adds more moisture.

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Very good idea using wine because wine boiling point even lower than water.

150
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So machine won't turn off by itself and also wine has more flavor.

151
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Not bad, not bad.

152
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Looking nice, looking nice.

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Crispy skin because it was kind of like in liquid,

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
but there's some browning.

155
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's quite pretty.

156
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
This is gorgeous.

157
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
There's like all this sauceiness.

158
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You see?

159
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
She trolled the whole pop of garlic in there.

160
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Uncle Roger, like garlic is one of Uncle Roger's favorite ingredient.

161
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Many needs an nephew complaining.

162
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Chopping garlic, peeling garlic.

163
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Make your hands smell like garlic.

164
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
This is the solution.

165
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't even chop.

166
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Just chop the whole thing in there.

167
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now that my chicken's done,

168
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm gonna get my potatoes ready.

169
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The same basket worked with cake.

170
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Hi, you have rice cooker.

171
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Why don't you just make rice as your cup?

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
No need potato.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
In life, you only need three packs of cup.

174
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Rice, noodle or rice noodle.

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hashtag potato soul name.

176
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Nice and nephew.

177
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Tweet this.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's get it trending.

179
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Finally, a dish that makes sense for a rice cooker.

180
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm going to make mussels and white wine.

181
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What?

182
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Finally, a dish that makes sense for a rice cooker.

183
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mussels and white wine.

184
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When she say a dish that makes sense for rice cooker,

185
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I thought she was going to make rice but mussels.

186
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
She chose to make chicken mussels and cake in rice cooker.

187
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That show you how versatile rice cooker is.

188
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Can make white people food also.

189
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mussels are in so many fancy restaurants.

190
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I think it's definitely something people associate with a higher price tag.

191
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But the whole joke is that mussels are actually super inexpensive.

192
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
They're one of the most affordable seafood options.

193
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
That correct.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It most affordable seafood option.

195
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
If you also like mussels that give you diarrhea.

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Onion, garlic, pepper flakes, white wine.

197
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You don't need much to give mussels such an incredible flavor.

198
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Wow, they're so pretty.

199
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Look good, not bad.

200
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Oh, this broth looks...

201
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Rough not bad also.

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So good.

203
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I just added some lemon.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Adding parsley.

205
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It looks...

206
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Fuiyo, this looks so nice.

207
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Good job, Nis Alexis.

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If Jamie Oliver sees this, I sure he will go...

209
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yeah!

210
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hi, I'm Ryan.

211
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm a...

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, now they do taste test with nephew Ryan here.

213
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A video producer at BuzzFeed, I make branded content.

214
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I cook out of necessity.

215
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't cook for pleasure.

216
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Like last night I had plain chicken and plain pasta.

217
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
And I ate it in the dark.

218
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What?

219
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What did he say?

220
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What did he say?

221
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Last night I had plain chicken and plain pasta.

222
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And I ate it in the dark.

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hi, I eat in dark.

224
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What are you poor?

225
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So poverty.

226
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
BuzzFeed pay or we joke I bet.

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
So he cut a f*** electric.

228
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, baby he too cheap and he want to save money

229
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
on electric bill high.

230
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Turn on like more.

231
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So you can see how terrible that shade of pink look on you.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Ha ha ha ha ha.

233
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Alexis has made a three-course meal for me

234
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
with a mystery appliance.

235
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't know what the appliance is,

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
but I'm going to try and guess.

237
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Bring them in.

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're a tree.

239
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're a tree.

240
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, yeah.

241
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This must be recorded before Covid time.

242
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I don't know.

243
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Uncle Roger misharking.

244
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,000
About...

245
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Okay, okay.

246
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
For your first course you...

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Ooh!

248
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
In white wine.

249
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Very nice.

250
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Do you like mussels?

251
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I love mussels.

252
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I love mussels.

253
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It's also what Auntie Helen say to me

254
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
right before she left me for that fitness motto.

255
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What is love?

256
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Oh my god!

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm so bad you're hungry because...

258
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ooh, chicken look good.

259
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,000
We're game hands.

260
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Look nice.

261
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Over some sauteed onions and mashed potatoes.

262
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Nice potato, so creamy and smooth.

263
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Very nice, nice Alexis.

264
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
This is so good.

265
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That is.

266
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well seasoned.

267
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Ooh.

268
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Whoa!

269
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Fuyo!

270
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
This chocolate cake looks so nice too?

271
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Oh, damn, that's too big.

272
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Uncle Roger getting hungry now.

273
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What do you think I used to make this meal?

274
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It had...

275
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
There had to be enough heat to get this crust

276
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
and like this...

277
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,000
G...

278
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
curling iron.

279
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

280
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What?

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Broom!

282
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What do you think I used to make this meal?

283
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Uh, curling iron.

284
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Curling iron!

285
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
How do you think she make mussels with curling iron?

286
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is she gonna co-every single mussel or something?

287
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No.

288
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I want to get it right.

289
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
A bathtub.

290
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Bath tub.

291
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
There's no fuel iron.

292
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Bad at turning light on and also bad at guessing.

293
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I think it's gonna take two more years before he gets it right.

294
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What next guest gonna be?

295
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Washing machine.

296
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Overheated laptop.

297
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Hiya.

298
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Oh, that's bad, yes.

299
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,000
That's it.

300
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
That's such a bad guess.

301
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You know it, bad guys and you still do...

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Right.

303
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I was right.

304
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Wow.

305
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Nice cooker!

306
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What?

307
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Just not bad, Miss Alexis.

308
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
This very good result.

309
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Uncle Roger approved

310
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Use rice cooker to make everything.

311
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Uncle Roger loves it when white people use rice cooker.

312
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Because it means you enlightened white people.

313
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Miss Annaphyu.

314
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Go get rice cooker.

315
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's so multi-purpose.

316
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Can make chicken, can make cake, can make mussel.

317
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But most importantly, can sing for you.

318
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But Miss Alexis is rice cooker fucker.

319
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is the same joke that I did in the Gordon Ramsay video.

320
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But it's still funny.

321
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
She's cheating ho.

322
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No light at all.

323
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why?

324
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
You live in America.

325
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Not gas or strip.

326
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Can I put it?

327
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I don't know.

328
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Put it in the blueprints.

329
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Neff fuel Ryan.

330
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Turn on light more.

331
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So you can see how terrible that shape of light like look on you.

332
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Light like, I think light like, it's funnier maybe.

333
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But Uncle Roger probably wouldn't know the word light like.

334
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
So it's maybe a bit off character.
